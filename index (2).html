<h1>Welcome to the Butler Beehive!</h1>
<h2>Butler College, a Princeton dormitory, was assigned the bee mascot upon its founding in 1983. Thus, Butler Princeton students are called Butler bees. The Butler bees would like to show you around! Take a look at what Butler bees (students) are like, including their study patterns, favorite dining foods, and more!</h2>

<h2>The typical day for a Butler bee is comprised of many hours spent working on various projects and assignments. Let's take a look at these busy bees!</h2>

<h2>The bees above working in the field represent Butler students working in Butler's study rooms. In the visualization, each bee is worth 1/5 of a person to indicate the average number of students found in Butler study rooms at any time. The ratio of bees pollinating to bees not pollinating denotes the average focus level and average frequency for markings found on whiteboards. The thermostat reads the average temperature of Butler study rooms and depicts a plot showing individual data points.</h2>

<h2>When they're not out in the field working, Butler bees spend their time in the Butler basement snacking on delicious honey, socializing with their peers, and more.</h2>

<h2>In the snapshot above, bees represent the average ratios for various data outlining the behaviors of Butler students in the Butler basement. The ratio of bees eating (those in the honey square) to bees not eating, bees alone to bees in groups, and group bee interactions dominated by an individual (symbolized by queen bee) to balanced group bee interactions all represent the average ratios found for Butler students.</h2>

<h2>Let's visit Wilcox Hive, where Bees eat!</h2>

<h2>Below is the layout of Wilcox Dining Hall (hall not hive). The location of food in Wilcox Hive is the same as Wilcox Hall, the only exception being the food itself and the bee consumers made to denote Butler students. The most popular Butler food stations are visualized as the most popular bee foods including nector, pollen, and honey. Among these most popular foods, the number of bees at these stations denotes the average wait time at the station. The more bees at a station, the longer the average wait time.</h2>
